# CURRENT TIME
## Certainly! The Current Time Display is a web feature created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically shows the current time to users visiting a webpage. The HTML structure includes a container (e.g., a <div>) to display the time. CSS styles enhance its appearance (e.g., font size, color). JavaScript updates the time every second using setInterval. It retrieves the current date and time, formats it (e.g., HH:MM:SS), and displays it on the page. This simple yet practical tool provides real-time information and can be customized to match any websiteâ€™s design. ðŸ•’ðŸŒŸ
